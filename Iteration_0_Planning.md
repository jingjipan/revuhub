The development of our movie categorization system will satisfy a much-needed niche in the movies and reviews ecosystem.  Current solutions for users seeking to research, review, and discover movies are typically feature-laden and resource intensive to view, especially on mobile devices.  These features, while sometimes useful, can be cumbersome for users seeking a more responsive system. Many of these aspects of current movie apps and websites are also very focused on external media, such as trailers or reviews by professional critics.

The aim of our project is to achieve the core functionality common to movie apps and take it down an efficient, user-focused path.  Our application will focus on both the user's ability to access and discover movie information through our search feature, and to record their own moviegoer history using our favourites list and review tools.  When using our app, our users will have their own lists and reviews at the centre of their experience.

In line with our design philosophy, we will consider our system successful if users are able to intuitively access our application's tools and features in a way that lets them feel involved and able to accomplish their own goals within the system.  Users should be able to publish their reviews and recognize that their additions to our review platform have an impact on future searches and categorizations.  Users should have enough ease searching and saving movies that they believe they are likely to return to our application to view their lists.  If we can invoke these responses from users without prompting or outside instruction, our vision will have been achieved.
