> Overall scope of project (including who the user are, and why we designed it)

Rev-U-Hub is an app that helps users to find the films best suited to them. The reason that we designed this app is to allow people who have already watched movies share their opinions with others who have not yet seen them by providing ratings and reviews. This will then allow other users to discern which movies are well-received by the community and furthermore, which will best suit them.

Rather than continuing to watch movies that aren’t best suited for you or walking into a cinema without knowing if you’re even likely to enjoy the movie, the Rev-U-Hub app will help you find the movies that you’ll enjoy the most. You will be able to easily see important information about the movie such the description, actors, writers and directors. You’ll also be able to see movie ratings as well as comments from other users. Based on these ratings and comments, you will be able to easily determine which movie you want to watch. After you watch the film, you can then leave your review and rating of the film to help other users decide if they should watch it in the future. 

Even in situations where users just want find a good movie for weekend, instead of wasting time searching for good movies, they can simply browse top-rated movies or browse movies by category. Users will then be able to stop wasting time searching for and watching movies that are not well-suited for them. In addition to this, users will be able to create an account and add movies to their favorites list so they can easily keep track of which movies they liked and which movies they want to watch in the future.

The development of our movie categorization system will satisfy a much-needed niche in the movies and reviews ecosystem.  Current solutions for users seeking to research, review, and discover movies are typically feature-laden, resource intensive and overwhelming to view, especially on mobile devices.  These features, while sometimes useful, can be cumbersome for users seeking a more responsive system. Many of these aspects of current movie apps and websites are also very focused on external media, such as trailers or reviews by professional critics.

The aim of our project is to achieve the core functionality common to movie apps and take it down an efficient, user-focused path.  Our application will focus on both the user's ability to access and discover movie information through our search feature, and additionally record their own moviegoer history using our favourites list and review tools.  When using our app, our users will have their own lists and reviews at the centre of their experience.

In line with our design philosophy, we will consider our system successful if users are able to intuitively access our application's tools and features in a way that lets them feel involved and able to accomplish their own goals within the system.  Users should be able to publish their reviews and recognize that their additions to our review platform have an impact on future searches and categorizations.  Users should have enough ease searching and saving movies that they believe they are likely to return to our application to view their lists.  If we can invoke these responses from users without any prompting or outside instruction, our vision will have been achieved.
